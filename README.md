# Wheelmap Research Spike

This is a research spike into what's possible with physical accessibility data from http://wheelmap.org and https://www.accessibility.cloud

## Demonstration Page

The demonstrate page in `web/index.html` can be viewed at https://rawgit.com/waharnum/wheelmap-spike/master/web/index.html or run locally.

It contains purely client-side code that uses Wheelmap and accessibility.cloud widgets plus custom Javascript to embed Wheelmap maps + accessibility.cloud results on a page, along with basic search functionality.

## Node Code

The file `index.js` is the starting point of some possible Node code for interacting with Wheelmap and accessibility.cloud, but I haven't done anything significant yet.
